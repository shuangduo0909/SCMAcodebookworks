# SCMA-codebook-results

This project contains the codebook design results  by the authors:

1.  "E2E-SCMAby\_joint\_mBPSK\_and\_RUA\_optimization": contains the current codebook design work results  from the manuscript of ''A Novel Constellation-Based Autoencoder for Irregular Sparse Code Multiple Access," which was submitted to TVT.

2.  "LP\_mBPSK\_DCMA" : contains the current codebook design work results  from the manuscript of ''Design of Low-Complexity DCMA Systems," which was submitted to TVT.

3.  "Structured\_codebook\_design": contains the current codebook design work results from the manuscript of ''Structured SCMA codebook design by joint parameter optimization based on union bound," which was submitted to CL.
